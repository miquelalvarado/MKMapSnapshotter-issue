# MKMapSnapshotter Issue

Using MKMapSnapshotter to generate a map snapshot worked properly in previous versions of iOS but somehow as of iOS 13 Beta3 it generates a black image instead. Please note that this was working in an app that is already published and when that project is compiled through Xcode11-Beta3 it shows a black image instead.
This project is a Demo to easily reproduce that issue.
